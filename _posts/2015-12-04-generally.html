    <h1>How I Redesigned An Arcade Racer At Age 14</h1>
    <p>December 4th, 2015</p>
    <br>
    <p>In 2004, I started playing a top-down arcade racing game called GeneRally. It's a simple game that let's you easily start a race and finish it in just a couple minutes.</p>
    <p>It was massive fun except it was a little bit too simple. I started downloading new tracks and cars that others had made but I prefer realistic racing games. I'm a huge fan of the Gran Turismo series and I wanted to play GeneRally with real cars on real tracks.</p>
    <p><strong>Unfortunately, the world-size is limited to a maximum value of 255.</strong></p>
    <p>Despite this, plenty of members had created awesome tracks based on real-world locations. Check out this comparison of Laguna Seca on Google Maps to the same track recreated in GeneRally.</p>

    <p>It's difficult to see, but even the elevation changes that this track is famous for is incorporated into the GeneRally edition.</p>
    <p><strong>Still, the gameplay remained the same.</strong></p>
    <p>Although the tracks were incredibly detailed, the gameplay was still very arcade-like because the cars hadn't changed.</p>
    <p>It's easy to understand how a limited world-size affects a track creator, but how does it affect a car creator?</p>
    <p>Well, a smaller world gives less space for a car to travel in and the cars are designed to accelerate quickly, change directions quickly, and slow down quickly to save space. It's like trying to race an R/C car around in your room.</p>
    <p>It's not realistic at all.</p>
    <p>I knew that in order to maximize the use of the limited world-size, I had to scale down my cars.</p>
    <p><strong>Here's what I changed.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Less power: lower top speed, decrease acceleration and deceleration</li>
      <li>More weight: decrease acceleration and deceleration further</li>
      <li>Less grip: emphasize importance of braking zones, corner-entry and corner-exit speed, and skillful steering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This worked quite well to simulate how real cars take time to accelerate, slow down, and turn. Also, making the cars slower overall meant they used up less space in the limited world-size.</p>
    <p>Now that the cars behaved like a real car, I had to make them look like a real car.</p>
    <p><strong>This is the basic GeneRally car, made with only 40 polygons and 29 vertices.</strong></p>

    <p>At first, I modeled the cars simply by looking at pictures but I could never quite get the proportions right. I also wasn't sure if the size of the cars I made were correct in relation to each other.</p>
    <p>To help me with this, I created a spreadsheet of cars and researched their dimensions of height, width, and length. I divided these numbers by a ratio and used this calculation to determine the coordinates of my vertices.</p>
    <p>I also dug around on the internet to find blueprints and compared them to my wireframe.</p>
    <p>Here's the result:</p>

    <p>Do you recognize this car? It's a Lambourghini Murcielago.</p>
    <p><strong>After I was happy with this car, I got a little crazy... I wanted more.</strong></p>
    <p>I started spending hundreds of hours watching comparison videos, car reviews, and did research on all sorts of cars.</p>
    <p>I took notes on how cars felt in relation to each other, which cars felt faster, which cars turned sharper, and which cars slid more. These were all immeasurable qualities that I wanted to incorporate into my cars.</p>
    <p><strong>One by one, I accumulated a collection of over 100 cars.</strong></p>
    <p>I picked a well-rounded track with both wide and tight turns, short and long straights, and various elevation changes as a testing ground.</p>
    <p>Then I spent hours and hours driving each car over and over again on the same track to tweak the subtle differences between them.</p>
    <p>It wasn't enough to have one realistic car. I had to have hundreds, all performing similarly in their class, while expressing their differences in strengths and weaknesses.</p>
