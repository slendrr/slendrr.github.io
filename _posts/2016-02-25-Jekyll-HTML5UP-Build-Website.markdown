My original website used a Bootstrap theme called "Off-Canvas", which appeared to be complete. However, the backend code was not optimized for adding and posting new content. Here's what the old website looked like.

Although the website looked complete, all the content shown on the website had to be manually coded and organized. Each separate page and category for my posts were all fake. I organized the pages and posts manually by writing the code for every instance to make it seem like the posts were automatically organized and categorized. In fact, the posts were not actually assigned a category to be automatically displayed on its corresponding page. I basically treated each page as a single website and wrote the code for each individual post-link. I used permalinks to tie it all together so that it looked like all my pages, posts, and links communicated with each other. In reality, they were simply flat pages with permalinks to link everything together.

This method of creating a website is effective but primitive. I have to spend time writing new code every time I want to add new content. Bootstrap is just a tool for designing a visually device-friendly layout. In order to build a functional website, I had to integrate a tool called Jekyll. Jekyll is able to generate webpages by grabbing bits of code from different places and piecing them together to create what you see on your internet browser.

For example, when you clicked on this blog post from the front page, Jekyll kept the same layout and replaced the contents of the front page with the contents of this blog post. I can make many different blog posts, save them all in one place, and Jekyll will know how many posts I have and build any blog post on demand.

Aside from lacking functionality, I also did not like the minimalistic appearance of the Bootstrap theme. The post-links were too small and displaced themselves depending on the length of the title and post description. I realized that if I wanted to take my website further, I would eventually have to fix all these problems. I hadn't even integrated social media sharing buttons or Google analytics yet. I decided it was time for a website revamp.

This time around, I've started with the default Jekyll template and integrated the HTML5UP theme "Future Imperfect" to create a visually appealing and fully functional static website & blog. By using the Jekyll template right off the bat, I can make sure that my website will be able to fully utilize the features of Jekyll. I customized the HTML5UP theme's header, menu, sidebar, and contents to suit the purposes of my blog. Piece by piece, I integrated the HTML5UP theme's code into my base Jekyll website until every page generated itself seamlessly.

Over the next few days, I will be working on polishing up my old posts and porting them over to this new website. My high-quality posts will be directly ported over, while other posts may be re-written or deleted all-together.

Still, this site isn't quite complete yet. I still have to add pages, categorize my posts, implement social media sharing buttons, and much more.
