    <p>The rain came down all at once. I don’t know when the seasons changed but they never stay the same. It is so different now that I don't even know what to call it. Even the yellow and orange leaves that litter the ground don’t stay the same.</p>
    <p>After the downpour the wind picks up. Literally, the wind picks them all up and tosses them back on to their branches. Some of them stay perched on the branches but the rest of them swoop down and level off before landing gently like a flock of birds. Shortly after they take off again, all together and in one direction. They make a sharp turn, all together, swoop again and land on the ground.</p>
    <p>It’s hard to keep up with them but I manage to catch up just in time before they take off again. This time they suddenly leap skyward and I chase them with my eyes and my head. The breath that I was running out of leaps out as well. I choke a little so I stop to take it back. With my hands on my knees and my head tucked in, I spot them flying a few feet away from beyond the ground, so I start chasing them that way too.</p>
    <p>I’m running and running to where the sky opens up and as I step over the edge I lose control. For a moment I feel like I’m falling into the sky and my mind goes reverse. I’m flying against up against the wind ever so briefly until I land so hard I shatter the sky.</p>
    <p>If you see it then you’ll understand.</p>
