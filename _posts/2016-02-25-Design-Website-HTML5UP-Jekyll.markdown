desc: I originally used Bootstrap to create a static website and integrated a few Jekyll features into the code. This time around, I've created a fully functional Jekyll blog with the HTML5UP theme "Future Imperfect".

Welcome to my new and improved blog! This is how it looked like before

<img src="images/firstsite.JPG"/>

The old website was created using a Bootstrap layout called "Off-Canvas", which refers to the sidebar's ability to toggle on or off the main canvas depending on the screen size. I started off by using the Bootstrap layout and tried to integrate some Jekyll features into the code. It appeared to be a very functional layout but it was very aesthetically minimal. I did not spend enough time on the back-end of the project and as a result, every post that I added to the website required me to write additional code.

This time around, I started off with a default Jekyll blog and slowly integrated the HTML5UP theme "Future Imperfect" to replace the layout. I also customized the sections and elements to suit the purposes of my blog. Now, I can add new posts and pages to my website by simply creating a markdown text file and saving it in my directory. No additional coding required. This gives me more time to focus on creating content!

Over the next few days, I will be working on polishing up my old posts and porting them over to this new design. My high-quality posts will be directly ported over, while other posts may be re-written or deleted all-together.

This site isn't quite complete yet. I still have to add pages and categorize my posts to make it easier for visitors to find what they're looking for.
