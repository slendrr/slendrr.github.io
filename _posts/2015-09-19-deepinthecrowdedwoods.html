    <p class="indent">I awaken to a dash of wind skipping across my face, hissing as it passes. The grass chatters and the trees moan as if they feel disturbed as well. A smell of sharpness lingers. I take a deep breath, rub my eyes, and wait for them to focus. They don't. The darkness seeps into my sockets and drips into my mind. I start to panic. A shock of adrenaline launches me to sit straight up. Just as I do, trees from all around me burst from the ground and reach high into the sky. Startled by their sudden appearance, I lose my balance. I try to secure myself with one arm flailing above my head and the other slapping around to find the ground. <i>Phew.</i>  I can see, but I don't recognize where I am. Is this a forest or a field? Neither of those words seem adequate. There are many trees, but they are spread apart and facing away from each other. If that's possible. If trees have faces. I feel uneasy, as if there was an argument and now no one wants to speak to each other. <i>Stupid. Trees don't speak.</i></p>

    <p class="indent">I glance up at the sky and the darkness starts to steal my sight once more. I can't tell how far I am looking because there is nothing for my eyes to focus on. The clouds and the stars are gone, and it seems the sun and the moon have left as well. I shake it off before my mind escapes my body. In the distance, I see an opening where the furry grass against the wind makes the hills look like they really are rolling. I don’t want to go there, into the openness. I don’t want to be swallowed up by the sky. Instead, I decide to go deeper into the trees. As I approach one of them, I circle around it a couple times to see which way it's facing. I put my hand on its bark and run my fingers down its grooves. <i>It's just a tree.</i> Nevermind that. Now, which way did I come from? I've lost my sense of direction already and the shallow density of the forest is consistent all 'round. I start to think the trees are staring at me like a stranger. But no, they're not. They're looking past me. Yes, I think they are mostly facing this way. I start wandering in the direction the trees are facing. I try to remind myself. <i>They don’t have faces.</i></p>

    <p>*Thump*</p>

    <p class="indent">A bump against a tree breaks my trance. I almost stumble to the ground but a low hanging branch catches my fall. <i>Sorry. Thanks.</i> When I let go, the branch raises itself back up to a more natural position, about 10 feet above the ground. <i>Hm.</i> I'm not sure how long I've wandered but the forest has gotten quite crowded. I try to peek ahead, dodging left and right, trying to see ahead of where I'm going but it's no use. There is always another tree immediately blocking my line of sight. I wonder what all the commotion is about? I pick up my pace. The trek gradually gets more and more difficult. I find myself ducking under branches and squeezing between trunks. The roots are all tangled so I have to tip-toe. There isn’t even a sliver of space in the ground for grass to grow. All the while I still can’t help myself from peeking ahead.</p>

    <p class="indent">I catch a glimmer of light. There's a bundle of trees huddled around it, casting their branches over top as if they are trying to protect it. I find a space between two trees and push their branches aside. I see something lying underneath the shade. It has a faint glow and the light is purely white. As my eyes adjust, I am more able to discern its shape. I kneel down and reach over to touch it. <i>Ouch!</i> The light flickers --<i>did it just shiver?</i> -- and fades to a slight glimmer, revealing it's smooth but porous complexion.  <i>Shit, what have I done?</i> My eyes are glued. I don't blink. My breath becomes frozen. The light... slowly returns to normal. My breath melts as I exhale with utter relief. I try to pick it up but this time I brace myself. It is cold, instantaneously cold, upon touch. I feel its hefty weight in my palms and its absolute coldness. I learn that it is just a sensation. It doesn't take away the warmth from my hands. <i>Let's go buddy.</i> The trees that were originally hunched over have twisted to face me. <i>Nonsense. They don't have faces.</i></p>

    <p class="indent">I look for where I came from and try to find an exit but there is no progress. Everything and everywhere is the same. It's frustrating. I guess I just need to keep going. At least, to go some-where. I start with one tree at a time. It's rhythmic. Hypnotic. On to the next. Past this one. It gets easier. Gradually, the forest ahead of me parts with every passing tree until a path begins to reveal itself. I imagine a long and dark corridor, penetrating the forest as far as I can tell. Excitement washes over me and I gather up my faded attention. My eyes re-focus as I to come back into consciousness. <i>The path is gone.</i> I tear up. <i>The path is gone!</i> I break into a panicked sprint, trying to chase the path and fighting my way through the trees. <i>Let me go!</i> Shocks of pain begin throbbing from the bottoms of my feet with each stride. The pain starts gripping my ankles and eventually claws its way up to my thighs. I stumble and fall. Coughing. Choking on that last breath. I'm crying out loud. Tears are running. Still coughing. Exhaustion takes over. The coughing stops as I find myself struggling to breathe. I've lost the stength to even use my diaphragm. The blood being pumped to my head is slowly spinning. <i>I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know why I'm crying. I don't know anything!</i> I roll my head further down into my chest, close my eyes and my let my mind roll off the edge. I fall and fall until my mind hits rock-bottom.</p>

    <p class="indent">A rumbling in my stomach awakens me. I sit up to find my buddy still shining brightly. I look around and realize that I actually managed to break out of the woods. There are still several trees lingering around but they seem to be minding their own business. Something starts tugging at me. Not literally. I mean really, but not physically. Like... forget it. We have to go outside. We are outside. I mean away from the trees, towards the hills. I still don't trust the sky but I go anyways. The openness makes me feel naked. Everything feels light and airy, even the aching pains in my legs. I gently lay it on top of the furry grass. <i>Is that good?</i> It doesn't respond. What the hell am I doing? I go down on all fours for a closer look. It starts rising steadily. I rise with it, lifting my head, then my back. On my feet now, watching it drift away, becoming smaller and smaller until I can't focus on it anymore because it is gone. All I see is the dark blue backdrop of the sky. <i>Hello?</i> The same landscape surrounds me in silence. <i>But, but I'm still here.</i></p>
