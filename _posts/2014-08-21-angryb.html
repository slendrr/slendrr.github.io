    <h1>Angry Birds: A Game Design Masterpiece</h1>
    <p>August 21st, 2014</p>
    <br>
    <p>Angry Birds was one of the first mega-hit mobile games to reach the market, long before Candy Crush or Clash of Clans entered the scene. I dive deep into the gameplay to discover why Angry Birds was such a huge success.</p>
    <p>First of all, it is important to understand that Angry Birds is fundamentally an artillery game. There are two key design distinctions that makes Angry Birds stand out from a typical Scorched Earth or Worms spin-off.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Motion-gesture controls</li>
      <li>Singleplayer gameplay</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These two distinctions work together with a focus on player interactivity to make the game easy to play, difficult to master, and tons of fun.</p>
    <p><h3><strong>Motion-gesture controls</strong></h3>Normally, an artillery game uses values such as power and angle to fire missiles at a target. You can see these values in the top-left corner of this Scorched Earth example:</p>
    <img src="/images/angryb_scorch.png"/><br><br>
    <p>A player will adjust the angle of their tank, set the power level and fire the missile. In Angry Birds, instead of a tank, the player is given a slingshot.</p>
    <p>This makes the game easier to play. When a user sees a slingshot and a bird hopping into the pocket, they already know what to do, no instructions needed (but they give them anyways).</p>
    <img src="/images/angryb_tut.jpg"><br><br>
    <p>As a bonus, there is more interactivity for a player when they directly manipulate what's on the screen using their finger rather than using buttons.</p>
    <p>This is a no-brainer when the game is played on a touchscreen device, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Now here's the critical distinction.</strong> They could have included power and angle values in the top-right corner of the game, but they didn't. These values still exist, but they are hidden from the player.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>This brings me to the next distinction.</p>
    <p><h3><strong>Singleplayer gameplay</strong></h3>
    In Scorched Earth (and basically every other artillery game), the target to hit is another player, another tank. This requires precise calculations of power and angle values.</p>
    <p>Without knowing the exact power and angle values of each shot, it can be incredibly difficult to hit a target. As it happens very often in artillery games, most of the shots don't even hit any targets. Boring!</p>
    <p>This is why the designers changed the target to a large structure built by the bad piggies. When every shot a player makes can easily hit the target, there is no need for precise power and angle values.</p>
    <p>Here is the catch. Every shot has varying degrees of effectiveness. This is communicated to the player in many ways.</p>
    <img src="/images/angryb_hit.jpg"/><br><br>
    <p>Visually, the structure collapses and breaks apart. There's lots of noise and explosions, points and cheering! Awesome!</p>
    <p>But what if the player makes a bad shot? Is it boring? Nope. The structure wobbles a bit, maybe some pieces topple over, the birds make funny noises, the piggies laugh, and the player gets to try again immediately.</p>
    <p><strong>Notice how slow everything happens.</strong> The moment a bird hits the structure, it triggers a slow motion domino-effect of pieces falling and breaking. The player is allowed to observe and gratify every bit of damage done to the structure. For more skilled players, this allows them to analyze how the wooden pieces behave differently from the stone pieces, and learn to make a better shot next time.</p>
    <p>Hitting the target and squishing the pigs can be easy to do, but being able to get three stars in every level is very difficult.</p>
