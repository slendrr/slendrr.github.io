    <h1>Angry Birds: A Game Design Masterpiece</h1>
    <p>This is an incomplete draft.</p>
    <p>August 21st, 2014</p>
    <br>
    <p>Angry Birds was one of the first mega-hit mobile games to reach the market, long before Candy Crush or Clash of Clans entered the scene. I dive deep into its gameplay to discover why Angry Birds was such a huge success.</p>
    <p>First of all, it is important to understand that Angry Birds is fundamentally an artillery game. There are two key design distinctions that makes Angry Birds stand out from a typical Scorched Earth or Worms spin-off.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Motion-gesture controls</li>
      <li>Singleplayer gameplay</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These two distinctions work together with a heavy focus on player interaction to make the game easy to play, difficult to master, and tons of fun.</p>
    <p><h3><strong>Motion-gesture controls</strong></h3>Normally, an artillery game uses values such as power and angle to fire missiles at a target. You can see these values in the top-left corner of this Scorched Earth example:</p>
    <img src="/images/angryb_scorch.png"/><br><br>
    <p>The player adjusts the angle of their cannon, sets the power level and fires the missile. In Angry Birds, these three actions are simplified with the slingshot. Adjusting the angle, setting the power and firing an angry bird is combined into one intuitive motion-gesture.</p>
    <p>This makes the game easy to play and lets the player directly interact with the game without using buttons. When a user sees a bird hopping into the slingshot, they already know what to do, no instructions needed (but they give them anyways).</p>
    <img src="/images/angryb_tut.jpg"><br><br>
    <p>This is a no-brainer when the game is played on a touchscreen device, right?</p>
    <p><strong>Now here's the critical distinction.</strong> They could have included power and angle values in the top-left corner of the game, but they didn't. These values still exist, but they are hidden from the player.</p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>This brings me to the next distinction.</p>
    <p><h3><strong>Singleplayer gameplay</strong></h3>
    In Scorched Earth (and basically every other artillery game), the objective is to hit another tank. This requires precise calculations of power and angle values.</p>
    <p>Without knowing the exact power and angle values of each shot, it can be incredibly difficult to hit a target. As it happens very often in artillery games, most of the shots don't even hit any targets. Boring!</p>
    <p>This is why the designers changed the target to a large structure built by the bad piggies. When every shot a player makes can easily hit the target, there is no need for precise power and angle values.</p>
    <p>Here is the catch. Every shot has varying degrees of effectiveness. This is communicated to the player in many ways.</p>
    <img src="/images/angryb_hit.jpg"/><br><br>
    <p>Visually, the structure collapses and breaks apart. There's lots of noise and explosions, points and cheering! Awesome!</p>
    <p><strong>Notice how slow everything happens.</strong> The moment a bird hits the structure, it triggers a slow motion domino-effect of pieces falling and breaking. This is how the game interacts with its players and allows them to observe and gratify every bit of damage done to the structure.</p>
    <p>For skilled players, watching the building slowly collapse also teaches them how different objects behave and interact so they can make a better shot next time.</p>
    <p>But what if the player makes a bad shot? Is it boring? No way. Even if you manage to completely miss the building, the birds make funny noises, the piggies laugh, and the player gets to try again immediately. This short iterative cycle allows the inexperienced players to experiment and learn with minimal setback.</p>
