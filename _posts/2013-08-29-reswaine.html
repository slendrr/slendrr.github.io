    <h3>kill me waine</h3>
    <p>the boy walks down the stone staircase
    <p>there are no lights it is dark</p>
    <p>still he could see sort of his outline</p>
    <p>legs bent arms tied facing up against the wall</p>
    <p>waine</p>
    <p>he spoke to him</p>
    <p>it is your turn</p>
    <p>he untied his arms</p>
    <p>i am dead already</p>
    <p>waine looked him in the eyes</p>
    <p>once brown eyes now brimmed with black</p>
    <p>are met with black pearls</p>
    <p>no</p>
    <p>you are not dead</p>
    <p>then kill me waine</p>
    <p>kill me so you can have</p>
    <p>everything i ever wanted</p>
    <p>there was no hesitation</p>
    <p>as they both reached for the blade</p>
    <p>and together they drove it into his stomach</p>
    <p>he slipped onto the floor</p>
    <p>waine made his way up the stairs</p>
    <p>the lights on the surface dived</p>
    <p>into his black pearl eyes deep</p>
    <p>to the bottom</p>
    <p>and is gone</p>
    <h3>i am the monster</h3>
    <p>i am seeing myself now</p>
    <p>she is clenching her chest with no breath</p>
    <p>the blackness in her pupils are spreading</p>
    <p>and dripping down her cheeks</p>
    <p>the memories flash back</p>
    <p>my fears suddenly creep up my throat</p>
    <p>and become real monsters help</p>
    <p>i changed myself to stop this</p>
    <p>i killed him so i could take his place</p>
    <p>and stop this from ever happening to me</p>
    <p>but once again i see him crying now</p>
    <p>she is crying now</p>
    <p>it is happening to me again</p>
    <p>except this time</p>
    <p>i am the monster</p>
