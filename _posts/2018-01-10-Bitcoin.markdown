<h2>Mission</h2>
To allow peer-to-peer online payments without a trusted third-party by forming a decentralized network of miners, incentivized to maintain an honest chain of transaction blocks.

<h2>Overview</h2>
First block: January 2009<br>
Supply limit: 21,000,000BTC bitcoins<br>
Issuance: Block reward<br>
Block confirmation: Proof-of-work<br>
Mining algorithm: SHA-256<br>
Block size: 1mb<br>
Developments: Segregated Witness, Lightning Network

<h2>Summary</h2>
Bitcoin is meant to be used as electronic cash. Bitcoin users store bitcoins in wallets and send bitcoins to other wallets by broadcasting a transaction to the network. The network batches thse transactions into a block, which contains a hash. The network is a group of computers that perform work to solve the hash in order to confirm the block. This activity is called mining because when a block is confirmed, the miner receives bitcoin as a reward, as well as transaction fees included in the block. All other computers in the network will verify that the completed hash is correct, accept the confirmed block, and start working on the next block. Over time, these blocks form a chain of transactions and acts as a public ledger to keep track of all bitcoins in the system. The remainder of this post will explain each of these elements in greater detail and accuracy.

<b>Wallets</b> are comprised of a <u>public address</u> and a <u>private key</u>. A public address is similar to your e-mail address. You show your public address to other users so they can send you bitcoins. Your private key is similar to a password. You use the private key to gain access to the wallet and send bitcoins to other users.

<b>Transactions</b> transfer ownership of bitcoins between wallets. The data contained in a transaction helps verify and determine the movement of bitcoins. Input data references an output from a previous transaction to verify that the bitcoins are available to be spent. The output data takes the verified bitcoins and sends it to a new wallet address. When a transaction is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network, it gets added into a block.

<b>Blocks</b> contain transactions and a hash of the previous block's data. Computers in the Bitcoin network perform an extremely complicated mathematical problem to solve this hash. Once the problem is solved, all other computers in the network can easily verify the solution, accept the block, and begin working on the next block. This connected chain of blocks is called a blockchain and writes a complete history of all bitcoin transactions since the first block. Changing transactions in a confirmed block in the blockchain would render the block data incompatible with subsequent blocks hashes.

<b>Full nodes</b> are computers on the network that perform the calculations necessary to solve a block's hash and confirm transactions onto the blockchain. This activity is called mining because a reward is given to the full node for performing this work. The reward is comprised of a predetermined amount of bitcoins as well as any transactions fee included in the block. Full nodes also save a full copy of the blockchain.

<b>Segregated Witness (SegWit)</b> was implemented to reduce the size of a transaction by segregating the witness data within a transaction. The witness data is necessary to check the validity of a transaction, but not required to complete the transaction. Reducing the data held in a transaction allows more transactions to be added to a single block without having to increase the block size.

<b>Lightning Network (LN)</b> is a side-chain that allows users to transfer bitcoins without broadcasting every transaction to the Bitcoin network. Users must open a channel and fund it with bitcoins to transact on the Lightning Network. The amount of bitcoins in the channel determines how much value can be passed between the two users. At any time, the two users can agree to close the channel and settle the amounts on the Bitcoin blockchain as a single transaction. Open channels can be extended like a web to connect all LN users to each other. This development is still a work in progress.
