            <h1>Analysis Of Angry Birds</h1>

              <p class="indent">Rovio Entertainment utilized new touchscreen technology to create a turn-based artillery game known as Angry Birds. They consolidated many complicated shooting variables into an intuitive motion gesture and managed to lower the learning curve while increasing the skill cap at the same time. Their decision to keep it a single-player game allowed them to make innovations in gameplay and focus on player interactions. In comparison to the most well-known artillery games such as Worms and Scorched Earth, Angry Birds is incredibly simplistic. However, such a comparison reveals that Angry Birds is not simple because it is a casual mobile game. Instead, it is a game design masterpiece.</p>
<p class="indent">The controls and mechanics of Angry Birds are completely different from an ordinary artillery game. Instead of using a cannon, or a tank, or a gun, the designers choose a slingshot to fire the birds. This is incredibly significant because a cannon must be controlled by adjusting the angle and power variables before firing the bird, whereas a slingshot only requires the player to perform one motion gesture. It is easy to mistaken this simple change as a way to make it easier to play on a mobile touchscreen device. However, the game designers deliberately left out any indication of angles or measurements of power and hides these variables. They still exist, but they are simply not shown. A familiar object, the slingshot, is shown and an angry bird is automatically loaded. As a result, players find it incredibly easy to learn how to fire the birds. The player simply drags the bird back using the touchscreen to extend the elastic and let go to fire the bird. It also creates more interactivity between the game and the player. Rather than using button controls to alter their cannon, or pressing a button to fire, the player participates in the act of directly manipulating the slingshot with their finger. Since the variables of angle and power are hidden this way, it makes it very difficult for a player to adjust their next shot, or replicate their previous shot exactly. This raises the skill cap and makes the game more difficult to master.</p>
<p class="indent">Normally, this configuration of controls would be unsuitable for ordinary artillery games because the goal is to hit a small target with pin-point accuracy. The skill involved relies on the players’ ability to calculate their angle and power against the wind to land a shot on the enemy. Traditional artillery games are multiplayer and all targets must have the ability to fire at each other. Using the controls of Angry Birds, it becomes very difficult to make a calculated shot, accuracy is sacrificed, and missing the target can be very anti-climactic. Since Rovio decided to make a single-player artillery game, the target does not have to fire back. The target can be anything! In this case, Rovio had the ingenious idea of making the target a large structure. Every shot a player makes can hit the target with varying degrees of effectiveness, which is communicated to the player in various ways. This is where the gameplay design becomes focused on how the game interacts with the player. The most obvious interaction to the player is showing the structure collapse. The player can see how effective their shot is as they watch the structure slowly collapse. Numbers are also shown to represent points gained from pieces colliding or breaking. Sounds of birds cheering, pigs grunting, and pieces breaking also reinforce different levels of success. An important, yet subtle design is how slow everything occurs. Most of the birds do not travel through the air incredibly fast, and from the moment of impact follows a slo-mo domino-effect of pieces falling and breaking. This contrasts with other games that incorporate large explosions and special effects to give the player more feedback for their simple action. Since the target in Angry Birds is much more complex, the player is allowed to observe and gratify every bit of damage done to the structure. For more skilled players, this allows them to analyze how the different pieces behave and learn to make a better shot next time. Hitting the target and squishing the pigs can be easy to do, but being able to get three stars in every level is very difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">The level design of Angry Birds also follows the trend of a simplistic yet functional design.  The birds line up on the left side of the level next to a slingshot, all facing to the right. There is also a large area of empty space on the right side of the screen, indicating to the player that this is the direction the game progresses. The first bird automatically jumps into the slingshot, and with no other distracting objects or graphics in the way, there is really only one option left for the player, which is to test out the slingshot! More complicated aspects of the game are slowly revealed to the player, but it all begins with this basic skill of using the slingshot. Cleverly designed bird characters that are all unique, easily distinguishable and behave similarly to their appearance, are slowly introduced to the player as they progress through the game. Again, the decision to show the impact of each shot very slowly, from the slingshot to the pig, allows players to observe carefully and learn gameplay mechanics and interactions. By keeping the special abilities of the birds as simple as possible, the developers can add a new type of bird without explaining how the bird works. The players can simply test it for themselves and see how different types of birds react to different objects. This process is very short and can be reiterated as many times as it is needed simply by resetting the level.</p>
<p class="indent">One aspect that Angry Birds struggles at is giving the player freedom. The only way to play each level is predetermined by the level designer. The birds line up in a specific order and the player must shoot them in that order. If the player were given the ability to choose which bird to fire, the player would be given more freedom and variety. This extra freedom can also make it slightly less accessible to a casual player, given there is an extra variable involved with beating a level. In order to mitigate this, the birds can line up in an order that makes it easiest for a player to complete the level, but not the most effective. In order to achieve 3 stars, a player must find his own solution. This maintains the same level of difficulty for casual players, while increasing the skill cap for hardcore gamers. This may be difficult to communicate to the player without an explanation, but visual cues such as the first bird in line jumping eagerly can be a hint to the player. To take this idea one step further and allow players to decide which birds to bring to each level would increase freedom even further. Although the idea is very similar, the effects of this change would actually diminish the quality of gameplay. If one type of bird is favourable in any way, the player may only choose that one bird and stick to one strategy. This decreases variety and the gameplay becomes stagnated. If a level is too complicated, then it may be too difficult to find the right combination of birds. The player will be spending too much time choosing birds and not enough time playing the game. Overall, I feel that these ideas take away from the simplistic design more than it brings to the gameplay, and that is probably the reason why they were not originally implemented. On the other hand, Rovio has been recently experimenting with new ideas such as power ups to spice up the game, but they also take away from its elegant and simplistic design.</p>
<p class="indent">Although Angry Birds is seems like a very simple mobile game, targeting the casual gamer, there are many design considerations that make it so successful. Simplifying the controls and removing the technical aspects of the game make it both easier to learn and harder to master. Instead, the game communicates complex interactions slowly and gradually as the player experiments, and the process is repeatable with little to no consequence. The game communications and interacts with the player massively for each and every shot that’s made because the target is complicated to take down but easy to hit. All these design aspects come together to create a game that is incredibly intuitive and easy to pick up, while also being immensely interactive and engaging.</p>
